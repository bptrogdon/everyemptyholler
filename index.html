            <p>The seminal art is finding what's hard, what's right and what's wrong (what's time and what's song?)</p>
            <p>I saw Jesus coming down,</p>
            <p>Daylight comes and it hurts, and you know why.</p>
            <p>Time is spent, waiting on the one you know to come back home.</p>
            <p>You sit in the room and cry for her, "Why me?"</p>
            <p>Fly's carcass on the wall. I think I may have killed them all.</p>
            <p>After 30 years, you'd think he'd tell me something I don't.</p>
            <p>You could be so much bigger than the rest,</p>
            <p>You were my sun, you were the shining sun.</p>
            <p>Hillbilly learned to read, scrying things.</p>
            <p>But I'll look for you in every empty holler.</p>
