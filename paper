            <h2>I. THE JUDGE-PENITENT</h2>
            <p>TO UNDERSTAND THE FATALISM THAT PERMEATES THE LITERATURE OF THIS SOIL, ONE MUST RECKON WITH THE INESCAPABLE NATURE OF ITS JUDGMENT[cite: 15]. THE APPALACHIAN SUBJECT EXISTS IN A "MALCOMFORT" CELL—A PUNISHMENT DESIGNED TO DISTORT THE HUMAN SHAPE UNTIL THE PRISONER CAN NEITHER STAND UP NOR LIE DOWN[cite: 17]. POVERTY IS NOT MERELY A MATERIAL DEFICIT; IT IS AN EXISTENTIAL MARKING[cite: 19]. TO BE RURAL IN AMERICA IS TO BE THE PUNCHLINE OF A JOKE YOU DID NOT WRITE[cite: 22].</p>
            
            <h2>II. THE RUPTURE OF DASEIN</h2>
            <p>IF POVERTY IS THE CONDITION, THEN THE LAND IS THE FOUNDATION OF BEING[cite: 35]. TO BE HUMAN IS TO "DWELL"[cite: 38]. MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL IS NOT MERELY ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION; IT IS AN ACT OF ONTOLOGICAL NEGATION[cite: 42]. WHEN THE PHYSICAL LANDMARKS OF MEMORY ARE BLASTED INTO DUST, THE COMMUNITY IS UNMOORED[cite: 43]. THE HOME BECOMES UNHEIMLICH—UN-HOMELY[cite: 46].</p>

            <h2>III. THE KNIGHT OF FAITH</h2>
            <p>BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF ENGINEERED RUIN, THERE IS A FEROCIOUS TRANSCENDENCE[cite: 61, 84]. RASH’S BECKY FUNCTIONS AS THE "KNIGHT OF FAITH," MAKING THE ABSURD MOVEMENT OF BELIEVING SHE WILL RECEIVE THE WORLD BACK DESPITE THE METH LABS[cite: 65, 66]. TO LOVE A RUINED PLACE IS THE BEGINNING OF UN-RUINING IT[cite: 76]. THE MOUNTAIN REMAINS[cite: 85].</p>
