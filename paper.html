                <h2>I. THE JUDGE-PENITENT</h2>
                <p>TO UNDERSTAND THE FATALISM THAT PERMEATES THE LITERATURE OF THIS SOIL, ONE MUST RECKON WITH THE INESCAPABLE NATURE OF ITS JUDGMENT. THE APPALACHIAN SUBJECT EXISTS IN A "MALCOMFORT" CELL—A PUNISHMENT DESIGNED TO DISTORT THE HUMAN SHAPE UNTIL THE PRISONER CAN NEITHER STAND UP NOR LIE DOWN. POVERTY IS NOT MERELY A MATERIAL DEFICIT; IT IS AN EXISTENTIAL MARKING. TO BE RURAL IN AMERICA IS TO BE THE PUNCHLINE OF A JOKE YOU DID NOT WRITE.</p>
                
                <h2>II. THE RUPTURE OF DASEIN</h2>
                <p>IF POVERTY IS THE CONDITION, THEN THE LAND IS THE FOUNDATION OF BEING. TO BE HUMAN IS TO "DWELL". MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL IS NOT MERELY ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION; IT IS AN ACT OF ONTOLOGICAL NEGATION. WHEN THE PHYSICAL LANDMARKS OF MEMORY ARE BLASTED INTO DUST, THE COMMUNITY IS UNMOORED. THE HOME BECOMES UNHEIMLICH—UN-HOMELY.</p>

                <h2>III. THE KNIGHT OF FAITH</h2>
                <p>BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF ENGINEERED RUIN, THERE IS A FEROCIOUS TRANSCENDENCE. RASH’S BECKY FUNCTIONS AS THE "KNIGHT OF FAITH," MAKING THE ABSURD MOVEMENT OF BELIEVING SHE WILL RECEIVE THE WORLD BACK DESPITE THE METH LABS. TO LOVE A RUINED PLACE IS THE BEGINNING OF UN-RUINING IT. THE MOUNTAIN REMAINS.</p>
