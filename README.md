# FATALISM AND TRANSCENDENCE: THE ONTIC VOID

> "The opioid crisis is not merely a medical failure; it is a symptom of the ontic void left by capital-driven erasure."

A digital scrying project exploring the dialectic between systemic erasure and the stubborn act of dwelling within the Appalachian landscape. This site serves as a companion to the academic inquiry presented at the 49th Annual Appalachian Studies Conference.

## THE MANIFESTO
This repository contains the source code for a high-modernist/vorticist digital interface. It is designed to be a wall of text—a collision of academic phenomenology and the material reality of the hoiler. 

- **BLESS:** The pre-reflective attachment to place, Heideggerian 'dwelling', and the lo-fi psychedelic protest.
- **BLAST:** Deterministic resource curses, sociological reductionism, and the erasure of the self.

## SONIC RESIN: EVERY EMPTY HOLLER
The project includes the audio component **EVERY EMPTY HOLLER**, a collection of outsider folk songs manifested between 2020 and 2025. 
- **Method:** Recorded exclusively on iPhone.
- **Philosophy:** The seminal art is finding what's hard, what's right, and what's wrong.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
- **Aesthetic:** High-contrast, all-caps, Vorticist layout.
- **Interface:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Grid and Clip-Path geometry).
- **Dynamics:** Drifting topographic background (60s linear drift) and jitter-filtered lyric blocks.
- **Architecture:** Hosted on GitHub Pages via the `.nojekyll` bypass.

## INSTALLATION / REPLICATION
To replicate the scrying interface:
1. Ensure `index.html`, `style.css`, and `.nojekyll` are in the root directory.
2. Upload `topo.png` to the root for the contour-drift background.
3. Configure GitHub Pages to build from the `/root` of the `main` branch.
